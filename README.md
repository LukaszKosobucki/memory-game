### Short Description

The game was made in free time as a project for fun. Since I love those types of games it was a breeze working on it. I'm definitely going to make more of memory like games. It was a challenging project mainly because of optimizaiton problems for mobile devices.

### During the development I have worked on different features:

* Designing the App from the ground using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/liG7SfaWsVWtOZiRGlLH6C/Memory-Game?node-id=2%3A4&t=p0TxR7YA7jFsowWb-1). 
* Making schematics for the game logic before implementation using [draw.io](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UkLWMNZVk5mMxgXBPL2mOY2-14Rt98AK/view?usp=sharing).
* Implementation of the App using React with Typescript.
* Simple firestore database for leaderboard.
* ~~Testing with Jest.~~
* xState for state management.
* Styling with styled-components and framer/motion.
* ~~Support for mobile devices using media-queries.~~
* I have scanned my project using [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=LukaszKosobucki_MemoryGame) for further optimization.
